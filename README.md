# 📊 Sales Promotion Insights Dashboard – AtliQ Mart

This project was developed as part of the **Codebasics Resume Project Challenge** to analyze the effectiveness of various festive sales promotions conducted by AtliQ Mart, a retail chain with 50+ stores across South India.

It also marks the beginning of my **Tableau journey** — my very first dashboard built using Tableau.

## 🎯 Project Objective

**AtliQ Mart** ran major promotional campaigns during **Diwali 2023** and **Sankranti 2024**. As a data analyst, my objective was to help the **Sales Director** make informed decisions by answering:

- Which promotions were successful?
- Which product categories saw growth or decline?
- How did different stores and regions perform?

I was responsible for extracting insights from the raw sales data and presenting them through an interactive dashboard tailored for business stakeholders.

## 📈 Key Insights

I designed an **interactive and impactful Tableau dashboard** with three focused analysis sections:
- **Store Performance Analysis**
- **Promotion Type Effectiveness**
- **Product & Category Performance**

Each dashboard dives into the respective metrics, comparing **before vs after promotion** periods across multiple business dimensions.

### 🔍 Major Business Insights:

- 💰 **AtliQ Mart saw a 1.5x revenue increase**, growing from ₹140,701,188 to ₹247,984,533 during the festive promotion period — an exceptional campaign outcome.
- 📉 However, **3 out of 5 promotions led to negative revenue impacts** across all regions.
- 🚀 The remaining **2 promotions**, especially **BOGOF** and **500 Cashback**, delivered strong revenue lifts that offset the underperformance of others.
- 📦 There was a **2x increase in total units sold**, rising from **209,050 to 435,473**, driven largely by volume-based promotions.
- 🏬 The dashboard covers **50 stores across 10 regions**, helping identify top-performing products, stores, and campaigns for future strategy.
